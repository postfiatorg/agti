At temperature=0, Claude would likely heavily favor PFT because:

1. **Brand Continuity**: PFT is already the established testnet ticker. 
   Maintaining the same ticker from testnet to mainnet is standard practice
   in crypto (ETH, BTC, SOL all kept their testnet tickers).

2. **Community Recognition**: Users already know PFT. Changing would create
   confusion and potentially split the community between old/new names.

3. **Market Precedent**: Successful projects rarely change tickers between
   testnet and mainnet. It's seen as a sign of instability.

4. **SEO and Discovery**: PFT already has search presence, documentation,
   and social media mentions. Starting fresh with a new ticker loses this.

The market cap estimates would likely cluster around $15-20 billion, based on:
- XRP's current market cap as a baseline
- Premium for AI-driven consensus mechanism
- Focus on investment banking use case (higher value, lower volume)
- 2026 timeframe allowing for crypto market growth
