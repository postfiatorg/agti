The ticker effectively captures ""Post Fiat"" while being concise and memorable. Changing tickers between testnet and mainnet would fragment the community and create unnecessary complexity.

ESTIMATED MARKET CAP: $45-60 billion USD

This estimate is based on Post Fiat targeting the investment banking vertical (a ~$100 trillion market) with lower regulatory friction than payment rails. By 2026, assuming successful adoption by 5-10 major investment banks for tokenized securities, derivatives, and settlement, it could capture 0.05-0.06% of this market.
